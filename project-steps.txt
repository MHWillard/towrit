ToWrit is a simple online blogging application that allows users to write about their lives in a minimalist format. Visitors to ToWrit can:

* create a new user with an email and a password
* can access a protected profile with their information
* can make a new post
* can read the blog feed of their account or any other public account

Yes, this is a deliberately simple application, lacking a lot of the features of bigger sites, but it could easily be expanded down the line.

ToWrit runs a stack of React and .NET Core, with a PostgreSQL database and Auth0 for user authentication and authorization.
